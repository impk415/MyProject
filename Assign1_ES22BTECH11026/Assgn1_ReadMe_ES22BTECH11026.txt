Hello.

To run the code, firstly you should open the input file named "inp.txt". 
You should first enter the value of N(i.e the no. of rows in the matrix), then give a space, then enter the value of K(i.e the no. of threads)

Then on the next line, please give the input matrix as SPACE-SEPERATED INTEGERS with each row on a new line.

For example, suppose N=4, K=2, and the input matrix can be given as an input in the "inp.txt" as follows:

4 2
1 3 5 2
4 9 6 1
0 7 9 5
6 4 2 6

Now after giving the input, IF YOU HAVE VS CODE on linux OS, you simply need to run the code. 
Corresponding to the code which uses mixed technique to distribute load among the threads, an output file named "output_mixed.txt" will be created.
(i.e "Assign1Src_ES22BTECH11026_mixed_technique.cpp")

Corresponding to the code which uses chunk technique to distribute load among the threads, an output file named "output_chunk.txt" will be created.
(i.e "Assign1Src_ES22BTECH11026_chunk_technique.cpp")

Corresponding to the code which uses mixed-chunk technique to distribute load among the threads, an output file named "output_mixed_chunk.txt" will be created.
(i.e "Assign1Src_ES22BTECH11026_mixed_chunk_technique.cpp")
