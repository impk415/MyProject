Readme OS Assgn2 ES22BTECH11026

I am also attaching 2 files, named "InputFile.txt" & "OutFile.txt" alongwith my code. My code basically reads the inputs of the variables 'N' & 'M' from the InputFile.txt and stores the values. So first, you should enter the values in the "InputFile.txt" in the following format "N M". I have intially set the content of the "InputFile.txt" as "1000000 8".

As you run the code(I request you to run the code on Linux, since I have wrote the entire code on Ubuntu Linux). I was facing some minor errors if I ran the code on VS Code in Windows.

You won't see any output once you run the code, since I am printing the output of the code in "OutFile.txt". You need to just write "cat OutFile.txt" in terminal to see the contents printed in the OutFile.txt. 

****IMPORTANT***** DON'T write "gcc Assgn2Src_ES22BTECH11026.c" to compile in Linux Terminal, INSTEAD WRITE "gcc Assgn2Src_ES22BTECH11026.c -o Assgn2Src_ES22BTECH11026 -lm". 

ALSO DON'T WRITE "./a.out" to run the program. INSTEAD WRITE "./Assgn2Src_ES22BTECH11026" to run the code.
